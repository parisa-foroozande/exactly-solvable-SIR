# Exactly Solvable SIR Models, Their Extensions, and Application to Sensitive Pandemic Forecasting

This repository contains a project exploring Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models, their extensions, and their application to pandemic forecasting, building upon the research by E. Sadurni and G. Luna-Acosta.

The project delves into the mathematical foundations and practical applications of SIR-type epidemiological models, focusing on scenarios where exact solutions can be derived. This is particularly relevant for understanding disease dynamics and making informed predictions.


## Key Aspects Covered:
### SIR and SIRD Models: 
Fundamental concepts of the SIR and SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) models are discussed.

### Extensions of SIR Models:

One Spatial Region with piecewise definition of infection rates.

One spatial region with time-dependent control parameters.

Two interacting regions, demonstrating the complexities of spatial disease spread.

### Reduction to Logistic Models: 
Exploration of how SIR models can be simplified or related to logistic growth models, including the Richards Model and SI Model.

### Exact Solutions: 
Detailed derivation and analysis of exact solutions for various model configurations, particularly for the Richards Model.

### Infection Peak Analysis: 
Investigation of methods to predict the peak of infections.

### Examples of Curve Fitting and Forecasting: 
Practical examples demonstrating the application of these models, including for real-world data like COVID-19 in Brazil.

### Discretization of Richards Model: 
Methods for discretizing continuous models for computational implementation.
